Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 

- But for numbers that are **multiples of three**, print `Fizz` instead of the number.

- For numbers that are **multiples of five**, print `Buzz` instead of the number.

- For numbers which are **multiples of both three and five** print `FizzBuzz`.

- For numbers that don't fit the rules above, just return the number


Sample output:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17

19

... etc up to 100
```
